                About Sabarimala Sree Dharma Sastha Temple
            </h1>
            <p>
                The Sabarimala Temple, located in the Periyar Tiger Reserve in the Western Ghats of Kerala, is one of the most famous and visited Hindu pilgrimage centers in India. Dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, the temple is situated atop a hill at an altitude of about 3000 feet and is surrounded by dense forests and mountains. Millions of devotees undertake the pilgrimage every year, especially during the Mandala and Makaravilakku seasons, following 41 days of strict vrata (austerity).
            </p>
            <p>
                According to legend, Lord Ayyappa, the son of Lord Shiva and Mohini (an incarnation of Vishnu), meditated at Sabarimala after fulfilling his divine mission of slaying the demoness Mahishi. He is believed to have chosen this forested hilltop to attain samadhi (spiritual union). The temple symbolizes harmony and devotion, welcoming people of all castes and creeds, although traditionally, women between ages 10 and 50 have not been permitted entry.

            <h2>About Lord Ayyappa</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    Lord Ayyappa, also known as Dharma Sastha, is a powerful Hindu deity symbolizing righteousness, celibacy, and detachment from materialism. He is the divine offspring of Lord Shiva and Mohini (the female incarnation of Lord Vishnu). Ayyappa is regarded as a protector of dharma and the destroyer of evil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After defeating the demoness Mahishi, Ayyappa chose the forested hill of Sabarimala as his place of meditation and eternal abode. The temple was built in his honor, and the pilgrimage to Sabarimala came to symbolize the victory of good over evil and self-discipline over desires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ayyappa is depicted as a yogi seated in a meditative posture (Yogapatta), signifying his commitment to celibacy and spiritual wisdom. His devotees refer to each other as “Swamiye Saranam Ayyappa,” expressing total surrender to the Lord.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The deity’s form represents a blend of Shaiva and Vaishnava traditions, and his temple is a confluence of Vedic, Tantric, and tribal customs. The pilgrimage is not just a journey of distance, but of spiritual transformation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Sabarimala Temple, surrounded by forests and hills, continues to be a sacred sanctuary of devotion, meditation, and divine energy in the heart of Kerala.
