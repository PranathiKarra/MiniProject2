                    Meenakshi (Sanskrit: मीनाक्षी, lit.'Mīnākṣī', Tamil: மீனாட்சி, lit.'Mīṉāṭci') is a term meaning "fish-eyed", derived from the words mina ("fish") and akshi ("eyes"). She was earlier known by the Tamil name Thadadakai ("fish-eyed one"), which was called later as Meenakshi. According to another theory, the name of the goddess means "rule of the fish", derived from the Tamil words meen (fish) and aatchi (rule). She is also known by the Tamil name "Angayarkanni" or "Ankayarkannammai" (literally, "the mother with the beautiful fish eyes").

                    <p>
                        Goddess Meenakshi is an avatar of Goddess Parvati Devi. She was born as the daughter of King Malayadwaja Pandya and his wife Kanchanamalai. This story is found in the Tamil text Tiruvilaiyatarpuranam.
                        The King and his wife were performing a Yagna to beget a son. But a beautiful 3-year old daughter rose from the fire and to everyone's shock, she was born with three breats. But a Divine voice spoke at that moment and announced that Meenakshi will loose her third breast when she meets the one who is destined to marry her. The King and Queen raised Meenakshi like their son and she learnt all the 64 arts (Chatushashti Kala). She defeated many powerful kingdoms through warfare and was crowned the successor of Malayadwaja Pandya.
                        Meenkashi lost her third breast and took on her divine form when she met Lord Shiva in his Sundereshwara form. She was married with great pomp and splendor to Lord Sundareshwara. Sundreshwara-Meenakshi Kalyanam
