    Sri Harmandir Sahib, also known as the Golden Temple, is a prominent Sikh Gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is the holiest shrine in Sikhism and is open to people of all faiths. The temple was founded by Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru, in 1577 and later completed by Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, in 1604. The sanctum was overlaid with gold foil during the early 19th century under the patronage of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, giving it the iconic golden appearance. Surrounded by the sacred Amrit Sarovar (Pool of Nectar), the temple represents infinite peace, equality, and spirituality.

<h2>About the Golden Temple</h2>
<ul>
    <p>
        The Golden Temple, also known as Sri Harmandir Sahib (literally, "The Abode of God"), is the most revered spiritual site of Sikhism. The word "Harmandir" is derived from the words "Hari" (God) and "Mandir" (temple), meaning the Temple of God. It symbolizes openness, equality, and humility. The temple was designed with four entrances, one on each side, to signify that it welcomes people from all walks of life and religions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The foundation stone of the temple was laid in 1581 by the Muslim saint Hazrat Mian Mir on the invitation of Guru Arjan Dev Ji, the fifth Sikh Guru. This powerful act symbolized interfaith harmony. The construction of the temple was completed in 1604, and the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of the Sikhs, was installed inside.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Golden Temple is built in the middle of the Amrit Sarovar (Pool of Nectar), from which the city of Amritsar gets its name. Devotees bathe in this holy water, which is believed to purify the soul. The entire structure is connected to the land by a marble causeway that represents the spiritual journey toward enlightenment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike Hindu temples where deities are worshipped in idol form, the Golden Temple is centered around the Guru Granth Sahib — the eternal Guru of the Sikhs. The scripture is recited continuously and carried ceremonially each morning and night to and from the Akal Takht, a sacred seat of Sikh authority located within the complex.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time, the upper part of the temple was covered with nearly 750 kg of pure gold, added during the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the early 19th century. This iconic gilded dome gave the temple its popular name — "The Golden Temple." Today, it stands as a universal symbol of peace, community service, and spiritual reflection.
