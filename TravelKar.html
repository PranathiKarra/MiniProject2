                    A 6 feet tall Shiva Linga here at the temple is known as the Atmalinga is worshipped here. Built using white granite, it is a classic example of the beauty of Dravidian architecture. A 1500 years old carved stone Lord Shiva idol in the standing position represents the main deity. The temple has been mentioned in the Hindu Mythics of Mahabharata and Ramayana and it is said to be as significant as Kashi, hence it earning the title, Dakshin (South) Kashi.</span><span id="dots-2">...</span><span id="more-2" style="display:none;">The top of the Atmalinga is the only part of the Linga that is visible to devotees. But during the Ashta Bandana Kumbhahishekam, a festival that happens once every 40 years, is when the entire Atmalinga is shown to the devotees. As per custom, devotees must first take a dip in the Karwar Beach, where the temple faces, visit the Maha Ganapathi Temple that is opposite the temple, then only visit the Mahabaleshwar Temple.</span>

                      Yana Caves in Karnataka's Uttara Kannada district are ancient rock formations, millions of years old. These black limestone monoliths rise 390 feet high, deep in the forests of Kumta. Located 50 km from Gokarna, Yana Caves are a place of wonder- ancient, untouched, otherworldly and unlike anything else.<span id="dots-3">...</span><span id="more-3" style="display:none;">The two massive peaks, Bhairaveshwara Shikhara and Mohini Shikhara, stand like natural towers. They hold religious importance, believed to represent Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Pilgrims visit in thousands, drawn by both faith and the cavesâ€™ eerie beauty.Reaching the caves requires a steep 3 km trek through thick forest and can get slippery during monsoon season. The surrounding village of Yana, with its mud roads and traditional huts, offers a glimpse into the rustic charm of rural Karnataka.</span>

                  Gokarna Beach is several kilometres long and is situated at the edge of the temple town. It has recently gained popularity as a go-to beach destination owing to its beautiful stretches of sand and pristine locations. Gokarna beaches were rarely frequented by the locals until foreign tourists started thronging the seaside. Soon, many locals opened stores selling souvenirs, unique cafes and beach shacks.<span id="dots-3">...</span><span id="more-3" style="display:none;"> It is quite popular with pilgrims who come to the town to seek the blessings of Shiva, Indian groups and with foreign tourists as well. The muddy uphill roads with forest cover on both sides provide for more than a reason to go for a hike or a family picnic. The steep rocks in the shallow sea allow rock climbing for the adventure junkies. Bird and animal life is plenty around the serene beaches. While in Gokarna Beach, taking a crash course in Yoga is also a great way to spend the mornings.</span>

                 Half Moon Beach is a small beach situated in Gokarna. It is separated from the Om Beach by a cliff from where tourists are bound to get an amazing view of the Arabian Sea. Numerous village huts in the classical Indian style can be spotted lined up by the beach giving it a rather traditional and homely touch altogether. The beach got its name from the striking resemblance that it exhibits with a half moon. <span id="dots-5">...</span><span id="more-5" style="display:none;">Away from the civilization and into the arms of nature, this is the best place to spend time at while looking at the caves and gazing at the sky lit with stars.Being at the beach is one of the most thrilling experiences as when you are bathing in the water of the Half Moon, all you can see ahead of you is the infinite ocean and behind is the lush and thick jungle making you feel as if you are the last living person left on the face of the earth.</span>
