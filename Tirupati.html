<h2>About Venkateshwara Swamy</h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                    Venkateswara[a] (IAST: Venkaṭeśvara) is a form of the Hindu god Vishnu and is the presiding deity of the Venkateswara Temple, located in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India. Venkateswara is also known by various other names.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Once, the sages wanted to decide the deity to dedicate a ritual. The sages appointed the sage Bhrigu to select the god. Bhrigu decided to test the gods. He first went to the god-king of heaven, Indra, who ignored the sage, and was busy in enjoying the dance of apsaras. Bhrigu cursed Indra that he would only be referred to as an egoistic soul, all over the universe. He next visited Brahma. Brahma was busy with his four heads in chanting the Vedas, performing meditation, creating the world, and spending his time with his wife, Saraswati. Next, he visited Shiva. Shiva was engaged in meditation with his wife, Parvati. Bhrigu cursed Shiva that he would be worshipped only in the formless lingam. At last, Bhrigu went to Vishnu. Vishnu was sleeping on the serpent Shesha, and his consort Lakshmi was at his feet. When Bhrigu arrived, he first saw Vishnu's feet, and felt humiliated. Enraged, he kicked Vishnu on his chest. Awakened, Vishnu started massaging Bhrigu's feet, and served him with great hospitality. Bhrigu was pleased, and ordered the sages to perform the rites to Vishnu. Lakshmi quarreled with Vishnu, as she felt that Bhrigu insulted her indirectly by hitting Vishnu on his chest where she lived, and thus left Vaikuntha.
            </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>Lakshmi settled on earth in the ancient city of Karavira, and meditated the name of Vishnu (regarded by adherents to be the site of the Mahalakshmi temple). Vishnu soon arrived on earth, searching for his consort. He failed to find her, and instead settled on the Seshachalam hills, the abode of the god Varaha. Vishnu sat inside an anthill, which was situated under a tamarind tree, and started chanting the name of his wife, Mahalakshmi.</p>
                    <p>The whole earth became gloomy. On the request of Parvati and Saraswati, Shiva and Brahma incarnated as a cow and a calf respectively, in the Chola kingdom. While taken on daily grazing in the Seshachalam hills by their owner cowherd, the cow would pour her milk into the anthill to sate the thirst of Vishnu. Once, the cowherd saw this act, and he threw an axe (parashu) on the cow and calf. Vishnu noticed, and in order to protect them, he arose from the anthill and the axe hit his own forehead (the blood poured as his namam on his head). An enraged Vishnu cursed the cowherd that he would die immediately, and the latter succumbed to the blow of his own axe. This news reached the Chola king. The ruler suspected the absence of the cowherd. He went near the grazing field, and was surprised to see the corpse of the cowherd. He went to the grazing field, where the cows were offering their milk to Vishnu. However, Vishnu was in disguise, and so the king could not identify him. The king strung his arrow, believing that the milk should serve the kingdom rather than the boy he saw. Vishnu, once again, emerged, and grew enormous, stopped the arrows from passing further and he cursed the king for not maintaining the dharma of his kingdom. The king repented and surrendered at the deity's feet. Unlike the cowhered, the king had realised his mistake, which pleased Vishnu, and hence presented him with the boon that he would marry the king's daughter in his next birth.
