                    <h2><u>
                        Poojas or Rituals of the Temple</u>
                    </h2>
                    <p>
    The Golden Temple follows a daily routine of spiritual services centered around the **Guru Granth Sahib**, which is treated as the living Guru. Unlike Hindu temples with multiple poojas, Sikhism practices a set of respectful rituals and prayers (Seva and Paath) throughout the day. These include the ceremonial opening and closing of the holy scripture, recitation of Gurbani (hymns), and continuous Langar (community kitchen) service.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Parkash Ceremony (Opening Ritual):</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Early in the morning (around 4:00 AM), the Guru Granth Sahib is brought from the Akal Takht to the sanctum in a grand procession with singing of hymns. The scripture is ceremonially placed on a raised platform (Takht) under a canopy.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>

    <li><b>Asa di Vaar and Kirtan:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Morning prayers including Asa di Vaar are sung by the Raagis (musicians) in the main hall of the Harmandir Sahib. The sacred hymns echo across the temple and reflect devotion, peace, and unity.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>

    <li><b>Ardas and Hukamnama:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Ardas (a prayer for the well-being of all) is offered, and a random verse (Hukamnama) is read from the Guru Granth Sahib. This is seen as the Guru’s guidance for the day.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>

    <li><b>Langar (Free Community Kitchen):</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Langar is prepared and served all day long to anyone who visits, regardless of religion, caste, or status. Volunteers help cook, serve, and clean. This service can feed up to 100,000 people a day.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>

    <li><b>Sukh Aasan Ceremony (Night Ritual):</b>
        <ul>
            <li>At night, around 9:30 PM, the Guru Granth Sahib is respectfully closed, placed in a palanquin, and carried back to the Akal Takht amidst prayers and music. This marks the end of the day’s service.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2><u>Festivals</u></h2>
<p>
    Several important Sikh festivals are celebrated at the Golden Temple with grandeur and deep devotion. The entire complex is illuminated beautifully, and special Kirtans and Langar are organized for visitors.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><u>Guru Nanak Jayanti:</u> Celebrates the birth of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism. The temple is decorated with lights, and continuous Kirtan and Akhand Path (non-stop reading of scripture) are conducted.</li>
    <li><u>Vaisakhi:</u> A major harvest festival and the day Khalsa was founded in 1699 by Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Large gatherings and holy dips in the Sarovar are observed.</li>
    <li><u>Diwali (Bandi Chhor Divas):</u> Celebrated in remembrance of Guru Hargobind Ji’s release from imprisonment. The temple is lit up with oil lamps and fireworks.</li>
    <li><u>Martyrdom Days:</u> Days commemorating the martyrdom of Guru Arjan Dev Ji and Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji are observed with special prayers and Kirtans.</li>
    <li><u>Gurpurabs:</u> Birth and death anniversaries of all ten Sikh Gurus are celebrated with deep reverence, spiritual gatherings, and community service.</li>
</ul>
