                <h1>About Kedarnath Temple</h1>
                <p>
                    Kedarnath Temple is one of the most revered Hindu shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva, located in the majestic Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India. Positioned near the Mandakini River at an altitude of 3,583 meters, it is part of the Char Dham Yatra and is believed to have been built by the Pandavas and later revived by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The temple is surrounded by snow-capped peaks and picturesque landscapes, attracting lakhs of pilgrims and adventure seekers every year. It is accessible only for six months due to extreme weather. Kedarnath holds immense spiritual value, especially during Maha Shivaratri and the annual opening and closing ceremonies.

                <h2>About Lord Kedarnath (Shiva)</h2>
                <p>
                    Lord Shiva, known as Kedarnath in this form, is considered the protector and destroyer in the Hindu Trinity. The name “Kedarnath” is derived from "Kedar," meaning field, and "Nath," meaning Lord – thus, “Lord of the Field.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    In mythology, after the war of Mahabharata, the Pandavas sought Lord Shiva to absolve their sins. Shiva, unwilling to forgive them easily, disguised himself as a bull. Bhima recognized the bull and tried to catch it, but the bull vanished into the earth. Later, Shiva appeared in his divine form and forgave them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is believed that different parts of Shiva's body appeared in different locations: the hump at Kedarnath, arms at Tungnath, face at Rudranath, navel at Madhyamaheshwar, and hair at Kalpeshwar – collectively known as Panch Kedar.
