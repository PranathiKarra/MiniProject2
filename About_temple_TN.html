<h2>About Meenakshi Amman</h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                    Meenakshi (Sanskrit: मीनाक्षी, lit.'Mīnākṣī', Tamil: மீனாட்சி, lit.'Mīṉāṭci') is a term meaning "fish-eyed", derived from the words mina ("fish") and akshi ("eyes"). She was earlier known by the Tamil name Thadadakai ("fish-eyed one"), which was called later as Meenakshi. According to another theory, the name of the goddess means "rule of the fish", derived from the Tamil words meen (fish) and aatchi (rule). She is also known by the Tamil name "Angayarkanni" or "Ankayarkannammai" (literally, "the mother with the beautiful fish eyes").
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meenakshi was an incarnation of the goddess Parvati, a form she took because of a boon she granted to her devotee, Vidyavati. Pleased with Vidyavati’s penance, Parvati agreed to be born as her daughter in Vidyavati’s next life.

And thus, Meenakshi came to be the daughter of Madurai’s king  Malayadhwajan and queen Kanchanamala, who was Vidyavati reborn. The royal couple could not have children for years and finally, as a solution, they performed a special yajna. At the yajna, Meenakshi emerged from the sacred flames as a three year old girl with three breasts and it was foretold that the extra breast would disappear when she met a man worthy to be her husband.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although the king had wanted a son, he accepted Meenakshi without hesitation, after hearing a voice that told him that to bring her up like a prince. She was destined to rule as a Pandian queen and would bring glory to his name.</p>
                    <p>After Malayadhwajan passed on, Meenakshi was crowned queen and she began to take out military expeditions to expand her father’s kingdom. On one such expedition to Mount Kalinga, she came head to head with Shiva himself. It had been prophesied that Meenakshi would instantly be able to recognise her future husband, which is exactly what happened when she laid eyes on Shiva. Within eight days, Shiva came to Madurai as Lord Sundareswar where they were to be united in matrimony.</p>
