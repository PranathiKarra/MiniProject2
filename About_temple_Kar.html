                    Shri Mahabaleshwar Temple, Gokarna is a sacred and historic Hindu temple located in the coastal town of Gokarna, in the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka, India. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, who is worshipped here in the form of the Atma Linga, believed to be the most powerful representation of Shiva’s presence. According to legend, the Atma Linga was originally gifted to the demon king Ravana by Lord Shiva and later became rooted in Gokarna after divine intervention by Lord Ganesha. This temple is one of the most revered Shaiva pilgrimage sites in South India and holds the same spiritual status as Kashi Vishwanath for many devotees.The Mahabaleshwar Temple is over a thousand years old and showcases classic Dravidian architecture. It has been mentioned in ancient Hindu scriptures and epics such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata. What makes this temple unique is that devotees are allowed to touch and perform abhishekam directly on the Atma Linga, a practice rare in most Shiva temples. The temple sees large gatherings during major festivals like Mahashivaratri and Shravan Mondays, with thousands of pilgrims offering prayers. Despite being a heavily visited site, the temple maintains its spiritual ambience and cleanliness, making it one of the most important Shaiva shrines and a highlight of religious tourism in Karnataka.</p>

<h2>About  Mahabaleshwar Linga</h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                    The Mahabaleshwar Linga, enshrined in the Shri Mahabaleshwar Temple in Gokarna, is one of the most sacred and powerful Shiva Lingas in India. It is known as the Atma Linga (Soul Linga), believed to have been gifted by Lord Shiva himself to Ravana, the mighty king of Lanka and a devout Shiva worshipper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       The term Mahabaleshwar (महाबलेश्वर) means "the Great Lord of Strength" (Mahā – great, Bala – strength, Ishwara – Lord), signifying Shiva's limitless power. The Atma Linga is said to embody Lord Shiva’s soul, unlike other Lingas which are symbolic or created for worship. This Linga is thus considered Swayambhu (self-manifested) and has an energy so potent that even the gods feared it could be misused.
According to legend, Lord Shiva granted the Atma Linga to Ravana after intense penance, with the condition that it should not be placed on the ground. The gods, alarmed by its power, requested Lord Ganesha to intervene. Disguised as a Brahmin boy, Ganesha tricked Ravana into placing the Linga on the ground at Gokarna, where it immediately rooted itself. Despite Ravana’s efforts to remove it, only the top portion broke off, while the rest remained firmly embedded in the earth.
                    </p>
                    <p>This rooted Linga became known as the Mahabaleshwar Linga, and the place where Ravana tried to pull it out shows the tilted Linga, which is still worshipped today. The temple was built around this sacred site, and what makes it unique is that devotees are allowed to touch and perform abhishekam (ritual bathing) on the Linga themselves—a rare privilege among Shiva temples.</p>
                    <p>The Mahabaleshwar Linga is believed to grant moksha (liberation) to sincere devotees and is spiritually equated with the Kashi Vishwanath Linga, making Gokarna one of the most important Shaiva pilgrimage sites in India.</p>
