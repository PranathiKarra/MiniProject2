                    <h2>Tips and Rules for visiting the Temple</h2>

<ol type="1">
  <li>Don’t wear revealing clothes that expose too much skin. Wear clothes that cover your legs and arms completely. Advisable for women to wear shawls. The temple authorities are very strict about the dress code so do make sure you are conservatively dressed.</li>
 <br> <li>Wear traditional Indian clothing like Sarees or Half-Sarees for women and Dhoti or Pancha for men.</li>
  <br><li>Leave your footwear and socks in your car or bus. You can’t wear it in the temple premises</li>
  <br><li>Mobile phones, cameras, electronic items, sprays of any kind, hand bags, backpacks wrist watches, calculators etc. are not allowed. Remember to leave them behind. If you still happen to have them with you, you will be forced to leave them behind in a locker near the entrance for a nominal fee.</li>
<br><li>Foreigners and non-Hindus are allowed to move around freely in the temple complex but are not permitted to enter the inner sanctum of either the Meenakshi Amman shrine or the Shiva shrine.</li>
<br><li>Foreigners will have to pay Rs.50/- to enter the temple premises</li>
<br><li>There are different tickets for special darshan (Rs.100/- for Amman and Shiva shrines and Rs50/- for any one shrine) and normal darshan (free for Indians). The difference between the two is that in special darshan the queue will be shorter and the normal darshan queue will be longer. No tickets for children up to 10 years of age. The price of a special ticket also includes one prasadam laddu.</li>
<br><li>Extra prasadam can be purchased at several prasadam counters.</li>
<br><li>As a special and unique service to small children, hot boiled mils is provided free of cost to children below three years of age</li>
<br><li>This is one of the primary temples for Shakta devotees and they visit the temple during December and January. This is also peak time for foreign devotees. The crowds will be higher during these two months.</li>
<br><li>The city gets very hot and dusty during summers; stock up with plenty of fluids and remember to stay hydrated.</li>
<br><li>Every Friday evening Meenakshi Amman and her consort Lord Sundareswarar are seated on a swing and slowly rocked. This is a way to celebrate the love between Shiva and Skakti. During the months of April/May the Thirukalyanam – or marriage ceremony between Meenakshi Amman and Lord Sundareswarar is celebrated in a grand and ceremonial manner.</li>
