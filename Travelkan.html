In the name Kamakshi, the letter 'Ka' represents Saraswati (the Goddess of knowledge and wisdom), 'ma' represents Lakshmi (the Goddess of wealth and prosperity), while 'akshi' refers to gracious eyes. Together, these three Hindu Goddesses or Devis form the holy trinity of the female transcendental energy of the universe.</span>
