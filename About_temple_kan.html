<h2>About Kamakshi Amman</h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                    Kamakshi (Sanskrit: कामाक्षी, lit. Kāmākṣī, Tamil: காமாட்சி, lit. Kāmāṭci) means “She whose eyes awaken desire/love” or “the one with loving or graceful eyes.” The name is derived from “Kama” (desire or love) and “Akshi” (eyes), signifying her compassionate gaze that grants boons and blessings to devotees.She is also known as “Shanta Swarupini”the embodiment of peace—and lovingly referred to in Tamil as Kanchipurathu Kamakshi.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       According to legend, Kamakshi is a divine incarnation of Parvati, the supreme goddess and consort of Lord Shiva. In a previous cosmic age, when the world was filled with chaos, the goddess took a fierce form to destroy evil. Her anger and energy were so intense that even the gods were frightened. To bring peace to the universe, Adi Shankaracharya is said to have established a Sri Chakra in the sanctum of the Kamakshi temple, transforming her from a fierce deity into her present benevolent, peaceful form.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another version of the legend narrates that Goddess Kamakshi performed penance under a sacred mango tree on the banks of the temple tank (Kamalalayam) in Kanchipuram, using a Shiva Lingam made of sand. To test her devotion, Lord Shiva sent floodwaters and fire, but the goddess protected the lingam with her body and her love. Pleased with her devotion, Lord Shiva appeared before her and agreed to marry her as Ekambaranatha, a union that is spiritually commemorated in both the Kamakshi and Ekambareswarar temples of Kanchipuram.Though Shiva temples are numerous in Kanchipuram, Kamakshi Amman is the only principal Shakti temple, symbolizing the central energy (Shakti) of the city. She is always depicted in a Padmasana (lotus) posture, a rare and deeply meditative stance, holding sugarcane, flower arrows, a noose, and a goad—symbolizing love, control over the senses, and spiritual awakening.</p>
